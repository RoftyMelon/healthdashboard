/* ============================================================================
   YOUR BLOODWORK. The single source of truth. blood-panel.html holds NO data.

   AI: to add a draw, read _readme.how_to_add_a_draw and follow it exactly.
   The two ways to ruin this file silently are (a) converting a value yourself
   and (b) guessing a unit. Do neither. Write what the lab printed, name its
   unit exactly as it appears in that marker units[] array, and return the
   whole file. The dashboard validates on load and will tell the user if you
   got it wrong — but a wrong-but-plausible number may not be caught.

 "_readme": {
  "what": "Bloodwork + supplement data for one person. THE single source of truth. The dashboard reads this file; so should any AI. Editing this file is how you add a new draw.",
  "how_to_add_a_draw": "APPEND one object to DATA.draws. Do not touch anything else. Do not reorder. Do not delete.\n  {\"id\":\"d2026jul\", \"date\":\"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"note\":\"lab, fasted?, on/off what\",\n   \"v\":{ \"<markerId>\": {\"r\": <EXACTLY what the lab printed>, \"u\": \"<the unit the lab used>\"} }}\nRULES, in order of how badly they bite:\n 1. NEVER convert a value. Write what the lab printed and name its unit. The dashboard converts.\n 2. \"u\" must be a unit LABEL copied EXACTLY from that marker units[] array (e.g. \"mg/L\", \"µmol/L\", \"G/L\").\n    If the lab used a unit not in that list, STOP and say so. Do not improvise a conversion.\n 3. \"<markerId>\" must be an existing id in MARK. If the lab reports something not in MARK, STOP and\n    say so rather than inventing an id — an unknown id is silently ignored.\n 4. Return the WHOLE file. Never a fragment, never a diff.",
  "units": "Each marker has a units[] array. Convert to the US unit with: value = u.fn ? a*raw+b : raw*m. The first entry is not special; u is an explicit index.",
  "optimal_ranges": "opt[] and oc are INFERENCES, not lab data. oc is the evidence behind the target: strong = outcome data (RCTs, dose-response vs hard endpoints); moderate = association studies or physiology; weak = convention or industry framing, no outcome data. 9 strong, 28 moderate, 29 weak. A value outside a WEAK band is an opinion, not a finding.",
  "clin_ranges": "clin[] IS lab data, off the report.",
  "dec": "Which supplements a marker bears on. Many-to-many. Membership does NOT mean the supplement moves it: cystatin C is under Creatine precisely because creatine CANNOT distort it, albumin is under Vitamin D because calcium cannot be corrected without it, selenium is iodine's cofactor, B12/folate are TMG's pathway.",
  "confounds": [
   "Creatine was active at the 2026 draw. It raises serum creatinine as substrate, not by damaging kidneys, and eGFR is CALCULATED from creatinine so it inherits the error. The eGFR of 61 is not readable as kidney disease. Cystatin C is immune and has never been drawn.",
   "The 2026 draw date (2026-03-01) is a PLACEHOLDER. Replace it. Every age and trend downstream depends on it.",
   "A free testosterone of 0.9 ng/dL (2023-01-30) was excluded as a suspected 10x transcription error.",
   "Topical minoxidil appears in no supplement group. That is the finding, not an omission: it is a potassium-channel opener with ~1.4% systemic absorption and no hormonal mechanism. Astaxanthin, lycopene, hyaluronic acid and collagen are absent for the same reason. No blood marker can falsify them."

  "subject": {
   "sex": "male",
   "country": "France (Strasbourg)",
   "diet": "See the DIET block. Rarely fish; lots of olive oil; high mozzarella, eggs (6-10/day) and potatoes; one Brazil nut/day. Huel Black is NO LONGER consumed (dropped as of 2026-07, exact stop date unrecorded) — it was regular through the earlier draws, so its fortification (iodine, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, B12, folate, magnesium, calcium, iron) is a confound for HISTORICAL draws only, not the current state.",
   "supervision": "none"
  },
  "stack": "Moved to the STACK block below — structured, with dose, status, category, meal slot and purchase URL. STACK is the single source of truth for supplements; do not re-list them here.",
  "lifestyle_blocks": "STACK, ROUTINE, CARE and DIET are structured lifestyle data, same contract as the rest of the file: exact, never inferred. STACK is organised in protocol phases: most items are status 'planned', gated on the first or second blood test of the new protocol (their category says which). STACK.items[].status is one of taking/candidate/stopped/dropped/planned. .when is the slot a supplement is taken with (presnack/brunch/dinner/evening) — null means NOT YET ASSIGNED, never guess it. Timing lives HERE, not in the categories: cats are protocol phases. .dec ties an item to its DECS group (verbatim label) so the dashboard can cross-link; null means no blood marker bears on it (see confounds). A category's .note is the user's own caveat, shown under the section header; a category with t:null renders HEADERLESS — only its note introduces its items. A DIET meal without .at is a plain food section: no time chip, no supplement slot; an item's optional .info is a caveat shown behind an info tip next to its name. ROUTINE times are HH:MM ascending; an entry's .until marks the end of a BLOCK (gym, work) and must be later than its .t; a routine entry's .slot pulls the matching STACK items at render time, so meal supplement lists are derived, never written twice. CARE holds the dental / face protocols, rendered as cards on the Routine page — deliberately NOT hour-by-hour events, they would duplicate. Meal supp lists are NOT stored anywhere: the Diet cards derive them from STACK.when (taking + planned) at render time, with an Evening supps card of its own — one source of truth for timing. DIET.meals[].id doubles as the when-slot key: an item with when:'brunch' belongs to the meal whose id is 'brunch' (slots: presnack/brunch/dinner/evening). In DIET, a '---' item is a course separator (starter / main / dessert), rendered as a gap. PRESCRIPTION.items is the flat list of biomarkers to collect at the next draw — strings, exactly as the lab order should read. A CARE card may split its items into .groups by cadence (Daily / Weekly / Yearly), same shape as TRAINING groups. TRAINING is {cardio, note, cards}: the gym program as Pull / Push / Legs cards, each organised in muscle-group .groups ('Accessory' holds what resists categorising). Every item is {n, sets:[[kg,reps],...]} — one pair per set, kg null = bodyweight, a '+' prefix = added weight, reps may be a duration like '0:30', sets [] = a protocol without logged sets; an optional .info string holds details shown behind an info tip. Copied exactly from the user's workout app; .cardio is the cardio baseline and .note the resistance caveat — the page renders them as labelled Cardio / Resistance sections. Doses write micrograms as mcg, never µg — µ uppercases into M and becomes a 1000x reading error.",
  "never_measured": "26 markers have no value in any draw. Highest value first: cystatin C (settles eGFR outright), ApoB and Lp(a), homocysteine (NAC raises it, TMG lowers it, net never seen), anti-TPO + free T4 (300mcg iodine; historical draws were ALSO under iodine-fortified Huel, since dropped), selenium, copper and zinc (BEFORE starting zinc), omega-3 index.",
  "self_check_before_returning_the_file": [
   "Every markerId in the new draw exists in MARK.",
   "Every \"u\" string appears verbatim in that marker units[] array.",
   "No existing draw was modified, reordered or dropped. Count them: there were 6.",
