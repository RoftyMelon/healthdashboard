   YOUR BLOODWORK. The single source of truth. index.html holds NO data.

   AI: to add a draw, read _readme.how_to_add_a_draw and follow it exactly.
   The two ways to ruin this file silently are (a) converting a value yourself
   and (b) guessing a unit. Do neither. Write what the lab printed, name its
   unit exactly as it appears in that marker units[] array, and return the
   whole file. The dashboard validates on load and will tell the user if you
   got it wrong — but a wrong-but-plausible number may not be caught.

  "what": "Bloodwork + supplement data for one person. THE single source of truth. The dashboard reads this file; so should any AI. Editing this file is how you add a new draw.",

NEVER convert a value. Write what the lab printed and name its unit. The dashboard converts.\n 2. \"u\" must be a unit LABEL copied EXACTLY from that marker units[] array (e.g. \"mg/L\", \"µmol/L\", \"G/L\").\n    If the lab used a unit not in that list, STOP and say so. Do not improvise a conversion.\n 3. \"<markerId>\" must be an existing id in MARK. If the lab reports something not in MARK, STOP and\n    say so rather than inventing an id — an unknown id is silently ignored.\n 4. Return the WHOLE file. Never a fragment, never a diff.",
  "units": "Each marker has a units[] array of {l, m} or {l, a, b} entries. Convert to the US unit with the entry whose l matches v.u: value = (a !== undefined) ? a*raw + b : raw*m. The first entry is not special; v.u names the unit by its LABEL, never by position.",
  "optimal_ranges": "opt[] and oc are INFERENCES, not lab data. oc is the evidence behind the target: strong = outcome data (RCTs, dose-response vs hard endpoints); moderate = association studies or physiology; weak = convention or industry framing, no outcome data. 3 strong, 29 moderate, 26 weak, 17 with no target at all. A value outside a WEAK band is an opinion, not a finding. A marker with NO opt is deliberate: it means no defensible target exists, and adding one back is a regression, not an improvement.",
  "clin_ranges": "clin[] IS lab data, off the report.",
  "dec": "Which supplements a marker bears on. Many-to-many. Membership does NOT mean the supplement moves it: cystatin C is under Creatine precisely because creatine CANNOT distort it, albumin is under Vitamin D because calcium cannot be corrected without it, selenium is iodine's cofactor, B12/folate are TMG's pathway. The DECS order is deliberate — grouped by primary biomarker domain (hormones/thyroid → lipids/cardio → liver/methylation → kidney/muscle → bone/minerals → aminos → foundational), NOT alphabetical; do not re-sort.",
  "confounds": [
   "Creatine was active at the March 2026 draw. It raises serum creatinine as substrate, not by damaging kidneys, and eGFR is CALCULATED from creatinine so it inherits the error. The eGFR of 61 is not readable as kidney disease. Cystatin C is immune and has never been drawn.",
   "Topical minoxidil appears in no supplement group. That is the finding, not an omission: it is a potassium-channel opener with ~1.4% systemic absorption and no hormonal mechanism. Astaxanthin, lycopene, hyaluronic acid and collagen are absent for the same reason. No blood marker can falsify them."

  "lifestyle_blocks": "STACK, ROUTINE, CARE and DIET are structured lifestyle data, same contract as the rest of the file: exact, never inferred. STACK is organised in functional categories; most items are status 'planned' — queued for the new protocol, not yet started. STACK.items[].status is one of taking/candidate/stopped/dropped/planned. .when is null (not yet assigned — never guess) OR an array of {at, dose}: one entry per meal slot it's taken at (presnack/brunch/dinner/evening), each carrying the PER-SLOT dose (astaxanthin = [{at:brunch,dose:12mg},{at:dinner,dose:12mg}]; the item's own .dose stays the daily total). Timing lives on the item (.when), not in the categories: cats are functional groups. .dec ties an item to its DECS group (verbatim label) so the dashboard can cross-link; null means no blood marker bears on it (see confounds). An optional .judge string is the readout — the marker or felt endpoint that decides whether a trial-tier (maylater) supplement is working — shown as a 'Judge by:' line under the item. A category's .note is the user's own caveat, shown under the section header; a category with t:null renders HEADERLESS — only its note introduces its items. A DIET meal without .at is a plain food section: no time chip, no supplement slot. A meal item is a string, or {n, info} — in a timed meal card, .info opens behind a hover info-tip on the name: .info is a string (plain caveat) OR a {section: [[label,value],…]} object rendered as a compact nutrition table (Huel Black uses this). ROUTINE times are HH:MM ascending; an entry's .until marks the end of a BLOCK (gym, work) and must be later than its .t; supplements are NOT shown in ROUTINE — they live only on the Diet tab (derived from STACK.when), so the routine just names the meal or event. CARE holds the dental / face protocols, rendered as cards on their own Grooming tab — deliberately NOT hour-by-hour events, they would duplicate. Meal supp lists are NOT stored anywhere: the Diet cards derive them from STACK.when (taking + planned) at render time, with an Evening supps card of its own — one source of truth for timing. DIET.meals[].id doubles as the when-slot key: an item with a when entry {at:'brunch'} belongs to the meal whose id is 'brunch' (slots: presnack/brunch/dinner/evening). In DIET, a '---' item is a course separator (starter / main / dessert), rendered as a gap. DIET.eveningAt stamps the Evening supplements card's time. NEXTDRAW.items is the biomarker list for the next draw — {en, fr} objects (English label + French lab name); the tab renders a two-column table (Marker | Pour le labo (FR)) with a button that copies every row as 'en — fr'. A CARE card may split its items into .groups by cadence (Daily / Weekly / Yearly), same shape as TRAINING groups, OR carry a .schedule instead — a day-indexed weekly grid (days[] with an optional tag + hi chip, sections[] (each an optional .icon: sun/sunset/moon) of rows {n, on:[day names], hi?}, plus notes[]) rendered as a dot-matrix (solid = applied, faint = skipped); the Skincare card (id 'face') uses this and every on-day name must appear in days[]. TRAINING is {cardio, note, cards}: the gym program as Pull / Push / Legs cards, each organised in muscle-group .groups ('Accessory' holds what resists categorising). Every item is {n, sets:[[kg,reps],...]} — one pair per set, kg null = bodyweight, a '+' prefix = added weight, reps may be a duration like '0:30', sets [] = a protocol without logged sets; an optional .info string holds details shown behind an info tip. Copied exactly from the user's workout app; .cardio is the cardio baseline and .note the resistance caveat — the page renders them as labelled Cardio / Resistance sections. Doses write micrograms as mcg, never µg — µ uppercases into M and becomes a 1000x reading error.",

NOT COMPUTED WHEN ALBUMIN EXCEEDS 40 g/L (4.0 g/dL) — the source lab's own rule, printed verbatim on the 2022 report: 'Calcium corrigé non indiqué car albumine >40 g/L'. Above that the correction subtracts a large (albumin − 4) from a calcium that needed no correction, turning a normal result into a falsely low one. Every draw here that measured albumin measured it above 40 (52.9 g/L in 2022, 51 in July 2026), so this row is expected to be EMPTY and that emptiness is the answer, not a gap: for this person, corrected calcium is not indicated.

Reached this file via an InsideTracker upload that re-converted the lab's SI values instead of transcribing them, so eight results were dropped entirely and six arrived rounded — all restored here from the report. THE LAB FLAGGED THREE VALUES: calcium 2.58 mmol/L against 2.15-2.50, creatinine 110 umol/L against 59-104, and potassium 4.7 against 3.4-4.5. Read the potassium with care — the report states 'legere hemolyse detectee dans le serum', and haemolysis releases intracellular potassium, which is the usual cause of a mildly high result on an otherwise normal panel. No albumin was measured, so corrected calcium cannot be derived for this draw. ONE VALUE HERE IS NOT FROM THIS COLLECTION: zinc (13.9 umol/L, atomic absorption, CERBA) was drawn 22.12.2020 at 09h58, twelve days later, and arrived with the same report bundle. Folded in deliberately rather than given its own draw — the time axis is in years, so twelve days is invisible, and a separate draw would add a table column in which 74 of 75 rows are empty.",

THE LAB FLAGGED THREE VALUES: albumin 52.9 g/L against 35-52, creatinine 106 umol/L against 59-104, and MPV 11.7 fL against 7.0-11.0 (no MPV marker in this panel; it was 9.2 in 2020). CRITICAL FOR THE CORRECTED-CALCIUM MARKER: this report prints, verbatim, 'Calcium corrige non indique car albumine >40 g/L' — the laboratory REFUSED to compute corrected calcium because albumin exceeds 40 g/L, which it does in every draw where albumin was measured (52.9 here, 51 in July 2026). Urea was deliberately not performed: the report states it is only reimbursed for dialysis, acute renal failure, or nutritional assessment in chronic renal failure, so the empty urea marker is a French reimbursement rule and not a dropped value. hs-CRP printed 'Inf a 0,5 mg/L' and is stored AT the limit, so read it as an upper bound.",

This is the value once stored as '0.9 ng/dL' and excluded as a suspected 10x transcription error — it was neither an error nor mislabelled: 9.3 pg/mL IS 0.93 ng/dL. What was wrong was the range it was judged against, the marker's 47-244 pg/mL, which belongs to a different method entirely. Kept as a note rather than a marker value: direct analog RIA free T is the method the Endocrine Society says not to use, and it shares no scale with the calculated free T this panel uses going forward. THE LAB FLAGGED THREE VALUES: platelets 153 against ITS OWN reference of 172-398 (this lab uses a narrower interval than the 150-400 this panel carries, so 153 reads normal here and low there), creatinine 106 umol/L against 59-104, and potassium 4.6 against 3.4-4.5 on a heparinised tube.

READ THE MPV SERIES WITH CARE: across four reports it splits perfectly by laboratory rather than by date — Clairval 9.2 and 9.4, La Rouviere 11.7, Barral 12.1. MPV rises as platelets swell in EDTA, so it tracks the delay to analysis and the analyser, not the patient. The line will look like a trend and is not one.

Reached this file via an InsideTracker upload that RE-CONVERTED the SI values instead of transcribing the printed US ones, which is why earlier entries drifted from the report (B12 551 vs the printed 554 ng/L, total T 625.4 vs the printed 629.30 ng/dL) — values are now stored as the lab printed them, in SI. TESTOSTERONE BIODISPONIBLE by RIA: 3.6 nmol/L / 1.05 ng/mL, in range against that assay's own printed reference of 2.7-12.0 nmol/L / 0.78-3.46 ng/mL. Kept as a note rather than a marker: one measurement on an assay not being reordered, and it cannot be compared to the calculated free T this panel uses going forward. The 'free testosterone 83 pg/mL' previously stored here appears NOWHERE in the lab report — an InsideTracker artifact, now removed.",

OFF creatine — the clean kidney read the March draw could not give. hs-CRP printed '<0.6' and anti-TPO '<8.0'; both stored AT the limit because r must be a number, so read them as upper bounds, not measurements. The lab refused erythrocyte magnesium and substituted serum (the marker is serum, so it lands correctly). The diet cut — mozzarella 400 to 200 g/day, eggs 10 to 6 — landed only 2 days before the draw, so the lipids still reflect the prior intake. Pending at Cerba/Barbier: ApoB, Lp(a), cystatin C, homocysteine, DHT, SHBG, zinc, copper, selenium, omega-3 index.",
