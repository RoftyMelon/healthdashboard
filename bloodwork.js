   YOUR BLOODWORK. The single source of truth. index.html holds NO data.

   AI: to add a draw, read _readme.how_to_add_a_draw and follow it exactly.
   The two ways to ruin this file silently are (a) converting a value yourself
   and (b) guessing a unit. Do neither. Write what the lab printed, name its
   unit exactly as it appears in that marker units[] array, and return the
   whole file. The dashboard validates on load and will tell the user if you
   got it wrong — but a wrong-but-plausible number may not be caught.

 "_readme": {
  "what": "Bloodwork + supplement data for one person. THE single source of truth. The dashboard reads this file; so should any AI. Editing this file is how you add a new draw.",
  "how_to_add_a_draw": "APPEND one object to DATA.draws. Do not touch anything else. Do not reorder. Do not delete.\n  {\"id\":\"d2026jul\", \"date\":\"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"note\":\"lab, fasted?, on/off what\",\n   \"v\":{ \"<markerId>\": {\"r\": <EXACTLY what the lab printed>, \"u\": \"<the unit the lab used>\"} }}\nRULES, in order of how badly they bite:\n 1. NEVER convert a value. Write what the lab printed and name its unit. The dashboard converts.\n 2. \"u\" must be a unit LABEL copied EXACTLY from that marker units[] array (e.g. \"mg/L\", \"µmol/L\", \"G/L\").\n    If the lab used a unit not in that list, STOP and say so. Do not improvise a conversion.\n 3. \"<markerId>\" must be an existing id in MARK. If the lab reports something not in MARK, STOP and\n    say so rather than inventing an id — an unknown id is silently ignored.\n 4. Return the WHOLE file. Never a fragment, never a diff.",
  "units": "Each marker has a units[] array of {l, m} or {l, a, b} entries. Convert to the US unit with the entry whose l matches v.u: value = (a !== undefined) ? a*raw + b : raw*m. The first entry is not special; v.u names the unit by its LABEL, never by position.",
  "optimal_ranges": "opt[] and oc are INFERENCES, not lab data. oc is the evidence behind the target: strong = outcome data (RCTs, dose-response vs hard endpoints); moderate = association studies or physiology; weak = convention or industry framing, no outcome data. 9 strong, 28 moderate, 29 weak. A value outside a WEAK band is an opinion, not a finding.",
  "clin_ranges": "clin[] IS lab data, off the report.",
  "dec": "Which supplements a marker bears on. Many-to-many. Membership does NOT mean the supplement moves it: cystatin C is under Creatine precisely because creatine CANNOT distort it, albumin is under Vitamin D because calcium cannot be corrected without it, selenium is iodine's cofactor, B12/folate are TMG's pathway.",
  "confounds": [
   "Creatine was active at the March 2026 draw. It raises serum creatinine as substrate, not by damaging kidneys, and eGFR is CALCULATED from creatinine so it inherits the error. The eGFR of 61 is not readable as kidney disease. Cystatin C is immune and has never been drawn.",
   "Topical minoxidil appears in no supplement group. That is the finding, not an omission: it is a potassium-channel opener with ~1.4% systemic absorption and no hormonal mechanism. Astaxanthin, lycopene, hyaluronic acid and collagen are absent for the same reason. No blood marker can falsify them."

  },
  "stack": "Moved to the STACK block below — structured, with dose, status, category, meal slot and purchase URL. STACK is the single source of truth for supplements; do not re-list them here.",
  "lifestyle_blocks": "STACK, ROUTINE, CARE and DIET are structured lifestyle data, same contract as the rest of the file: exact, never inferred. STACK is organised in functional categories; most items are status 'planned' — queued for the new protocol, not yet started. STACK.items[].status is one of taking/candidate/stopped/dropped/planned. .when is the slot a supplement is taken with (presnack/brunch/dinner/evening) — null means NOT YET ASSIGNED, never guess it. Timing lives on the item (.when), not in the categories: cats are functional groups. .dec ties an item to its DECS group (verbatim label) so the dashboard can cross-link; null means no blood marker bears on it (see confounds). A category's .note is the user's own caveat, shown under the section header; a category with t:null renders HEADERLESS — only its note introduces its items. A DIET meal without .at is a plain food section: no time chip, no supplement slot. A meal item is a string, or {n, info} — in a timed meal card, .info opens behind a hover info-tip on the name: .info is a string (plain caveat) OR a {section: [[label,value],…]} object rendered as a compact nutrition table (Huel Black uses this). ROUTINE times are HH:MM ascending; an entry's .until marks the end of a BLOCK (gym, work) and must be later than its .t; a routine entry's .slot pulls the matching STACK items at render time, so meal supplement lists are derived, never written twice. CARE holds the dental / face protocols, rendered as cards at the foot of the Stack page — deliberately NOT hour-by-hour events, they would duplicate. Meal supp lists are NOT stored anywhere: the Diet cards derive them from STACK.when (taking + planned) at render time, with an Evening supps card of its own — one source of truth for timing. DIET.meals[].id doubles as the when-slot key: an item with when:'brunch' belongs to the meal whose id is 'brunch' (slots: presnack/brunch/dinner/evening). In DIET, a '---' item is a course separator (starter / main / dessert), rendered as a gap. DIET.eveningAt stamps the Evening supplements card's time. NEXTDRAW.items is the flat list of biomarkers to collect at the next draw — strings, exactly as the lab order should read. A CARE card may split its items into .groups by cadence (Daily / Weekly / Yearly), same shape as TRAINING groups. TRAINING is {cardio, note, cards}: the gym program as Pull / Push / Legs cards, each organised in muscle-group .groups ('Accessory' holds what resists categorising). Every item is {n, sets:[[kg,reps],...]} — one pair per set, kg null = bodyweight, a '+' prefix = added weight, reps may be a duration like '0:30', sets [] = a protocol without logged sets; an optional .info string holds details shown behind an info tip. Copied exactly from the user's workout app; .cardio is the cardio baseline and .note the resistance caveat — the page renders them as labelled Cardio / Resistance sections. Doses write micrograms as mcg, never µg — µ uppercases into M and becomes a 1000x reading error.",
  "never_measured": "26 markers have no value in any draw. Highest value first: cystatin C (settles eGFR outright), ApoB and Lp(a), homocysteine (NAC raises it, TMG lowers it, net never seen), anti-TPO + free T4 (300mcg iodine; iodine-fortified Huel spans the historical draws and is back at 90g/day), selenium, copper and zinc (BEFORE starting zinc), omega-3 index.",
  "self_check_before_returning_the_file": [
   "Every markerId in the new draw exists in MARK.",
   "Every \"u\" string appears verbatim in that marker units[] array.",
